# password-generator

[![Build and Deploy](https://github.com/The-Noah/password-generator/workflows/Build%20and%20Deploy/badge.svg)](https://the-noah.github.io/password-generator/)

First [#7Days7Websites](https://7days7websites.glitch.me/) project.

A very simple password generator written in vanilla JavaScript, but uses SCSS for styling.

## Hosting

You will have to compile `style.scss` to plain CSS, but after that all files are static and the only thing you have to do is copy `index.html`, `app.js` and `style.css` to your hosting provider root.
